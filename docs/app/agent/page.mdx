# Lilac CLI

Welcome to the Lilac CLI documentation. This guide provides instructions for both submitting training jobs and running the agent on your nodes.

The `lilac` binary serves two primary purposes:

1.  **User CLI**: For data scientists and ML engineers to submit training jobs to the Lilac control plane.
2.  **Agent**: A daemon that runs on compute nodes, connects to the control plane, and executes assigned jobs.
