# Welcome to Lilac

Lilac ensures your data scientists always have enough GPUs for their work. We seamlessly connect compute from any source, on-prem or cloud. We provide a web-based UI for management, a powerful control plane for scheduling, and a lightweight agent for job execution.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Lilac, we recommend starting with the **[Quick Start](./quick-start)** guide. This will walk you through the initial setup and configuration, helping you get up and running in no time.

## Key Components

The Lilac platform is composed of several key components, each with its own dedicated documentation section:

- **[Agent](./agent):** Learn about the Lilac agent, responsible for executing jobs on your nodes.
- **[Backend](./backend):** Information on the control plane, scheduling, and management of jobs.
- **[Frontend](./frontend):** Interface for managing your clusters, queues, and jobs.
